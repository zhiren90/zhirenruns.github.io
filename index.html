                    <p>My name is Zhiren. I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://engineering.brown.edu/solid-mechanics-research"/>Solid Mechanics program at Brown University</a>.</p>
                    <!--
                    <p>I received my undergraduate degree in civil engineering at University of Massachusetts, followed by graduate studies in solid mechanics at University of Minnesota and Johns Hopkins University. I left my PhD program in 2017 to pursue industry opportunities.</p>
                    <p>After enjoying two years of work-life balance, I regained a strong desire to probe the mechanical properties of materials in a rigorous manner. Luckily, I found the opportunity to work with Prof. Jon Estrada at the University of Michigan and have been serving as a visiting researcher at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/esmech"/>Experimental Soft Mechanics Laboratory</a>, while contemplating a formal return to academia.</p>
                    -->
                    <p>I conduct research in the <a href="https://appliedmechanicslab.github.io"/>Applied Mechanics Lab</a>, under the guidance of Professor Haneesh Kesari. My ongoing project explores the mechanics behind traumatic brain injury, aiming to improve the efficiency and accuracy of tracking rigid body motion of skulls, assessing the applied dynamic loading in real-time, predicting the response of tissues and cells to forces and high-rate deformation, and inferring physiological properties from mechanical behaviors. With the principles of solid mechanics, I wish to lay the groundwork for improved disease and injury diagnostics, inspire minimally invasive medical procedures, and help save lives.</p>
                    <p>I am generally fascinated by elegant experiments that are rooted in theories and capable of efficiently informing us of how materials and structures deform and fail. Particular soft spots include: optic-, acoustic-, and thermal-based processes to quantify stress and strain, scaling laws and size effects, and in vivo/situ alternatives to traditional bulk property measurement procedures.</p>
                    <!-- <p>I also aspire to advance the theories of continuum mechanics by borrowing ideas from mathematics and other branches of natural science. As the great psychologist Abraham Maslow noted, "if the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail." Our perception of a research problem is sometimes restricted by our familiarity to well-established theories. Therefore, I strive to broaden my intellectual horizon and adopt new perspectives to analyze problems in solid mechanics.</p> -->
                    <p>My side passion is the history of science and engineering. I am the creator of the Twitter series <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dailymechanician"/>#DailyMechanician</a>, through which I hope to share bits and pieces of how the field has evolved, while putting faces to the names behind important equations and landmark papers.</p>

                        <p>It is impractical to directly measure the deformation of a human brain during injury-inducing events. The overarching goal of our work is to indirectly yet accurately estimate the strains and strain-rates experienced by the brain tissues. Our strategy consists of the following elements: (1) a computational algorithm to reconstruct the rigid body motion of the skull via accelerometer data, (2) a wearable sensor system for evaluation of blast pressure, and (3) a theoretical framework to predict cell damage according to surface traction and displacement of the brain. </p>
                        <p>On a practical level, we aim to develop wearable products that can provide real-time injury risk analysis to atheletes, military personnel, and other high-risk populations. More fundamentally, we hope to inspire procedures to infer sub-surface medical conditions from perceivable surface phenomena, via the theories of mechanics.</p>

                        <p>This work has been conducted under the mentorship of <a href="https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/esmech"/>Prof. Jon Estrada</a> at the University of Michigan since 2019. <!--It evolved into a collaborative effort between Michigan and Brown when I moved to Providence in 2022.</p> -->
                        <p>Soft polymers and biological tissues are difficult to model theoretically, given their time-dependent and highly heterogeneous behaviors. It is even more challenging to experimentally characterize these materials. Inertial micro-cavitation rheometry (IMR), developed by Prof. Estrada, is a promising technique that allows for soft materials to be characterized at ultra-high stretch rate (10<sup>3</sup> â€“ 10<sup>8</sup>/s).</p>
                        <p>I have been improving the theoretical and computational framework behind IMR by: (1) introducing advanced viscoelastic laws to describe complex time-dependent behaviors, (2) implementing reduced-order modelling procedures to rapidly achieve inverse characterization. For details, please refer to my publications [3] and [4].</p>
